# Smart-Fan-Using-Firebase and kodular
The aim of this project is to turn on the fan when the sensor detects harmful gases in the vicinity, so as to eliminate the gas. In addition, the system also allows monitoring from a mobile phone, including displaying gas concentration values and providing notifications through the Smart Fan app.
#  How to Works
The way this tool works is when the MQ2 sensor detects gas, the LED and fan will automatically turn on. The user will also receive a notification along with the gas concentration value detected by the sensor via cellphone.
